This is a 360 image capture of an at home office where I, as well as my family complete our work in the comfort of our own homes. Since the rise of COVID-19 and the pandemic, more and more people have had to work from home in order to maintain safe environments that would prevent the spread of disease. While many have been able to return to their office, working from home has still become a staple in the modern world.

This is a 360 image capture of a restaraunt in Dedham, MA. This restaraunt opened at the start of the pandemic and used to have dividers between tables in order to allow patrons to feel most comfortable when dining near other parties. The title "A return to Normalcy" indicates that more recently the business has been able to get rid of their dividers and mask policies and allow customers to enjoy a proper, and more normal restaraunt experience.
